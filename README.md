## Cat Mayors: The duelling city-building sim

### Design a city for the happiest cats

As a billionaire mayor (and also a cat) who recently purchased an uninhabited island, you have a dream of creating a paradise for cat clan to have plenty of snacks, take plenty of naps and play plenty of tricks to their hearts desire.

Looks like someone messed up the purchase, and another mayor also has ownership of the island!. Build structures alongside your rival mayor, but remember: your goal is to bring happiness to your clan of cats.

### What happens in a week on this island?

### Meet Tireless Tommy, the blueprint merchant!

To build structures, you need to buy blueprints from Tommy. Tommy runs a blueprint shop on a cart, and he comes around to your office twice a day.

#### Blueprints are hard to find.

Tommy only has 2 blueprints on sale everyday. If you can catch him in the morning, you get to pick a blueprint of your choice. However, if you only meet him at night, you can only purchase the leftover blueprint. Wake up early if you want to choose your blueprints!

### Meet Bobcat the Builder!

Bobcat turns your **Blueprints** into **Structures**! Just tell him where to place it. Different blueprints can only be built in specific kinds of terrain. For example, the "Rock" blueprint can only be built on __Red__ hilly tiles.

#### Bobcat's quite a lazy fella...

However many blueprints you have, Bobcat always refuses to build the last one. What a waste.

### In a week:

- Spend the first 4 days acquiring blueprints from Tommy.
- Then, spend the next 3 days building structures with Bobcat.
- The last day is spent watching your clan enjoy the city you have built for them. So yeah, 8 days in a week.

### What are the signs of a happy clan?

- When cats are doing activites they love, they produce **Stars**. Accumulating **Stars** is the goal of the game.
- The activities that cats love are conducted in **Star Structures**

#### What are **Star Structures**?

- Cat Beds: When cats visit the Cat Beds, the cat's clan gains stars based on his __Naps__ stat.
- Fountain: When cats visit the Fountain, the cat's clan gains stars based on his __Snacks__ stat.
- Tower Tree: When cats visit the Tower Tree, the cat's clan gains stars based on his __Tricks__ stat.

Cats with stats that resonate well with the star structure they visit will produce more stars for their clan.

#### We need cats to visit these buildings!

Invite the cats from your clan to join your city by building structures that **Gain X Cats**.

#### How do cats gain stats?

Some structures you build in your city give stats to your cats when they visit it. For example: Cats that visit the **Tuna Factory** gain 2 __Snacks__ stats!

In summary: Happy cats gain stars. Happy cats gain more stars if they have high stats. Choose your blueprints well, and build them in the right locations.

#### Building a city ends at some point:

After 4 weeks of obtaining blueprints and building structures, both mayors will be evaluated based on the number of stars. Highest Stars wins! But of course everyone wins too because building a city from scratch is awesome.
